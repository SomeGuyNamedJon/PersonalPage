### Page currently taken offline to save on AWS costs. Might look into converting this project into a static site for github pages

## About:
This is a spruced up capstone assignment for my Web Technologies class during my final semester at Uni.
<br />
<br />
I'm using this currently as a resume of sorts. Almost entirely data driven; I'm using php to build html from a mysql database to load content which is made dynamic through nested AJAX queries.
<br />
<br />
As it is my latest, I would also consider this my best work.

## TBD//:
Build api and tweak things here and there.
