# PersonalPage
### This project is hosted at [jonathanvillarreal.dev](https://www.jonathanvillarreal.dev)
#### Migrated from AWS to InfinityFree, as such it's no longer a live repo so it's a bit harder to work with. Retiring this project for now

## About:
This is a spruced up capstone assignment for my Web Technologies class during my final semester at Uni.
<br />
<br />
I'm using this currently as a resume of sorts. Almost entirely data driven; I'm using php to build html from a mysql database to load content which is made dynamic through nested AJAX queries.
<br />
<br />
As it is my latest, I would also consider this my best work.

## ~~TBD//:~~
### ~~Build api and tweak things here and there.~~
### Project will lie dormant for now. Still figuring out API routing with apache .htaccess instead of NGINX
