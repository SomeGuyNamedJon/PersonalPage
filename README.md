### This is repo is my personal web page hosted at https://jonathanvillarreal.dev

## About:
This is a spruced up capstone assignment for my Web Technologies class during my final semester at Uni.
<br />
<br />
I'm using this currently as a resume of sorts. Almost entirely data driven; I'm using php to build html from a mysql database to load content which is made dynamic through nested AJAX queries.
<br />
<br />
As it is my latest, I would also consider this my best work.

## TBD//:
Small tweaks here and there, I'm looking next to implement monads for my buisiness logic since it's still a bit messy in parts.
I also would like to build an api for managing site content. I may end up building it in php like I have for my CompanyEquipment project, but perhaps I'll do some research into something else to extend the breadth of languages for this project.
