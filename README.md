# PersonalPage
### This project is hosted at [jonathanvillarreal.dev](https://www.jonathanvillarreal.dev)
#### Migrated from AWS to InfinityFree, as such it's no longer a live repo so it's a bit harder to work with. Figuring out a good workflow to still update this website. 

## About:
This is a spruced up capstone assignment for my Web Technologies class during my final semester at Uni.
<br />
<br />
I'm using this currently as a resume of sorts. Almost entirely data driven; I'm using php to build html from a mysql database to load content which is made dynamic through nested AJAX queries.
<br />
<br />
Because of the nested queries, it is quite slow. I'm much happier so far with the page I made for [Marty Kitchen Art](https://github.com/SomeGuyNamedJon/martykitchenart). I plan to do something similar for a revamp of this page which will be it's own seperate project, existing through github pages instead of finding somewhere to host.

## TBD//:
### This project is retired.
InfinityFree does not allow api calls, at least not without upgrading. So there is no reason to finish out the api
